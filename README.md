## Purpose of solution:
The problem statement we were given addressed the issue of the lack of engagement by students in non-stem subjects. Students feel like some subjects are heavily relied on textbooks and therefore donâ€™t find learning enjoyable. So, we set out to create a fun, interactive game that allows students to test their spelling, expand their vocabulary, and essentially enhance their literacy skills.

## Technologies

Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- REST APIs

Our UI used HTML and CSS to render a sleek and stylish interface for the user. Responsive styling and animations on buttons and modals provide a smooth and natural user experiece our intended users. We had implemented consisent colour themes and our UI design to complete the project.

Our frontend used JavaScript connect the UI, the backend and an external ditionary API, and also executed the game logic. 

- Query Selectors and Event Listeners were use to interact with the UI. 
- REST APIs is used to fetch defintion of words from the external dictionary API (https://api.dictionaryapi.dev).
- REST APIs is also used to connect with our self-developed backend.
- We use a speech synthesis function to provide verbal prompts to users.

Our backend used JavaScript to respond to REST APIs queries made by the frontend. It will retrieve a pre-defined word list in a JSON file and keep track of the word list the user is playing to avoid giving out repeated words.
